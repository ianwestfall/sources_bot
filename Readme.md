# Sources Bot
Sources Bot is a Discord bot to annoy your HEMA friends. If someone mentions sources, it will reply telling them which
source it thinks their topic is from. The chosen source is random. This is not a scholarly bot.

# Configuration
The Docker image requires a single configuration value, a Discord bot token, passed as the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment
variable.
